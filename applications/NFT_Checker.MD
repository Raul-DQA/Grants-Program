### Overview

NFT Checker’s goal is clear: to make NFTs practical, valuable, and trusted, driving adoption across multiple sectors. With Polkadot’s infrastructure, this vision becomes scalable and impactful, positioning both NFT Checker and Polkadot as leaders in real-world blockchain applications.
NFT Checker addresses a critical need in the NFT market: trust and utility. By bridging Web2 and Web3, this platform enables users to verify and leverage NFTs securely for real-world applications, including healthcare, wellness tourism, e-commerce, gaming and many more.
This project isn’t just about recovery; it’s about redefining the purpose of NFTs. By integrating with Polkadot, NFT Checker will deliver:
- **Authenticity**: Robust verification systems to ensure trust and transparency.
- **Scalability**: A seamless connection between traditional systems and decentralized platforms.
- **Practical Utility**: Real-world value through tokenized rewards, secure services, and exclusive benefits.
- **Fraud Prevention**: Implementing advanced anti-fraud mechanisms to combat scams that have eroded trust in the NFT market. By ensuring rigorous verification and monitoring, NFT Checker aims to restore confidence and promote a safer environment for NFT transactions.

### Project Details

#### Background

The NFTChecker, developed by DQA, is a solution designed to address two critical issues in the NFT market: utility gaps and trust erosion. Built to bridge real-world applications with digital ecosystems, this platform isn’t just about NFTs - it’s about solving real challenges.
This proposal seeks funding to:
- **Integrate Polkadot Blockchain**: To enhance the platform’s scalability, efficiency, and security.
- **Expand Operational Capabilities**: To deliver value through real-world applications, starting with telemedicine, e-commerce, user data management, gaming and wellness tourism.

#### How it works

To obtain a real-world product or service through our NFT Checker platform, follow these steps:

*1. Acquire the NFT:*
 - a) Visit a supported NFT marketplace.
 - b) Log in with your digital wallet.
 - c)Purchase the desired NFT associated with the product or service you're interested in.

*2. Redeem Your Product or Service:*
 - a) Navigate to the NFT Checker platform.
 - b) Log in using the same wallet to access your NFT holdings.
 - c) Select the NFT corresponding to the product or service you wish to claim.
 - d) Initiate the redemption process to receive a voucher or code for the real-world product or service.
 - e) During this process, NFT Checker temporarily locks your NFT in a smart contract to prevent double-spending.

*3. Retrieve Your NFT:*
 - a) After the specified locking period (which varies depending on the NFT collection and associated partner agreements), return to NFT Checker.
 - b) Log in with your wallet.
 - c) Withdraw your NFT from the smart contract back into your wallet.

*4. Future Actions:*
- a) Once reclaimed, you can choose to resell, gift, or utilize the NFT again, depending on its terms and conditions.
- b) This streamlined process ensures a secure and efficient way to redeem NFTs for tangible products and services, maintaining the integrity of each transaction.

#### The Problems We’re Solving

The NFT space has been plagued by **scams** and **a lack of practical use cases**, eroding trust and slowing adoption. With **NFT Checker**, we are addressing these issues head-on:
**- Restoring Trust**: By enabling **authenticity, verification, and transparency.**
**- Redefining Utility**: By creating a platform that empowers NFTs to serve real-world purposes, from healthcare to e-commerce.


### Ecosystem Fit

#### WHy Polkadot?

Polkadot is particularly strong in the **NFT sector**, with platforms like **Unique Network, KodaDot, and NFTMozaic** driving innovation and adoption. These projects enable seamless NFT minting, trading, and cross-chain transfers, enhancing liquidity and market accessibility.

By leveraging Polkadot’s **interoperable ecosystem and NFT-focused infrastructure**, we unlock new opportunities for **cross-chain NFT verification, data-driven insights, and scalable digital asset management**.

#### Unlocking NFT Liquidity and Data-Driven Monetization

![NFT CHECKER POLKADOT INFOGRAPHIC](https://d3t4nwcgmfrp9x.cloudfront.net/upload/consejos-google-drive.jpg)

Polkadot provides the infrastructure, but the real value comes from how we leverage NFT data. NFT Checker does more than just verify assets—it transforms fragmented NFT markets into structured, monetizable ecosystems. With our ability to **track every NFT holder across Polkadot’s parachains**, we are not just ensuring authenticity, we are unlocking new business pipelines.
The NFT space is evolving beyond collectibles. **Every NFT holder represents a recurring revenue opportunity**, and our data-driven model turns that potential into tangible business outcomes.
*- Data = Business* – NFT ownership, activity, and transaction patterns become actionable market intelligence.
*- Cross-Chain Market Expansion* – We unify NFT data across Unique Network, KodaDot, and NFTMozaic, making Polkadot’s fragmented NFT ecosystem a single, monetizable asset pool.
*- Real-World Conversion* – Raw blockchain data is transformed into business opportunities in Web2 and Web3, ensuring sustainable revenue streams.
*-Continuous Monetization* – Once an NFT holder is identified, they become an ongoing engagement point for targeted sales, gaming incentives, and ecosystem interactions.

By integrating **Polkadot’s cross-chain infrastructure with NFT Checker’s advanced verification and analytics**, we are building more than a tool - we are creating a **data-powered engine that turns every NFT transaction into a long-term economic opportunity**.

## Development Roadmap :nut_and_bolt:

This section should break the development roadmap down into milestones and deliverables. To assist you in defining it, we have created a document with examples for some grant categories [here](../docs/Support%20Docs/grant_guidelines_per_category.md). Since these will be part of the agreement, it helps to describe *the functionality we should expect in as much detail as possible*, plus how we can verify and test that functionality. Whenever milestones are delivered, we refer to this document to ensure that everything has been delivered as expected.

Below we provide an **example roadmap**. In the descriptions, it should be clear how your project is related to Substrate, Kusama or Polkadot. We *recommend* that teams structure their roadmap as 1 milestone ≈ 1 month.

> [!CAUTION]
> If any of your deliverables are based on somebody else's work, make sure you work and publish *under the terms of the license* of the respective project and that you **highlight this fact in your milestone documentation** and in the source code if applicable! **Projects that submit other people's work without proper attribution will be immediately terminated.**
